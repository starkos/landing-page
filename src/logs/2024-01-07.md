blurb: A little bit of everything
---

Somewhere along the way I allowed myself to fall back into the old habit of creating to please others instead of focusing on my own guidance and my own desires. Creative death! As a result I've been misprioritizing. I wanted to start this work log *for myself* at the start of the year but I got focused on the mechanics of publishing rather than writing and that sucked all the air out of the endeavor. I am pleased that I had the awareness to recognize that something was amiss and step back from it to gain perspective.

So it's 2024 and I'm making changes. I've significantly cut back my billable hours and am taking a slow but steady bite out the savings (acknowledging my privilege to _have_ savings) to allow the space to—I would say "create again" but it's as much to just _be myself_ again. But myself loves making things so one goes with the other.

2024 has so far:

- Bootstrapped the websites---a [personal landing page](https://starkos.me), a [creative outlet](https://onebetween.net), and [my once and future company site](https://industriousone.com)---on [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), along with a [shared common code module](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-publish/tree/develop) so I don't have to repeat myself. Enjoying Eleventy and old-school static sites again. Still sorting out some navigation stuff so not much to see yet but definitely coming soon.
- Threw together [a little executable](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-starter) to bootstrap new multi-platform .NET solutions to my preferences so I can easily spin up new prototypes and playgrounds for ideas. Yeah, I wrote [Premake](https://premake.github.io) but if I start looking at that I know I'll get all sucked in and I have other things I want to explore first.
- Tackled the anxiety causing mess that is "everything that isn't part of the GTD system": all the notes and clipped articles and archived prototypes scattered all over the place. Bit the bullet and went full [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com), suffered through yet another taxonomy definition session. It hurt as they do but I'm increasingly happy with the result and it is _so_ nice to be able to have a thought and just _flow_ it right into the system. I'll probably write all of this up at some point, but not until things settle in.
- Played a bit with [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org). Would really love to commit to UE but that learning curve! And honestly I think my heart is pulling for Godot.
- Been reading [Essential C♯](https://essentialcsharp.com/home) to get caught up on all the stuff that got added while I was away.
- Signed up for [Bumble BFF](https://bumble.com/en/bff) because mine have all dispersed and I need to find more of my people. This might not seem like a creative activity but I found that when I shifted my perspective and treated it as such it because a really rather fun semi-collaborative mixed media project. A few tentative connections so far, we'll see how it goes.
- Continued doing the Java/AWS/ETL work for money. Wrestled with [Dagger](https://dagger.dev) and the [Java Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls) trying to get them to play nice together. Still having a hell of time getting it to reliably pick up source file changes. Thinking that I'm not getting paid enough for this.
- Started playing [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game) (so good so far) and more of the [Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com) MSQ (I am in the Heavensward post-story).
- Tried so hard to get back to drumming even semi-regularly. Would love to take lessons in 2024 but not until I know that I'll show up to practice.

This is where I would look at that list and reflexively say how "productive" the break has been, but that would miss the point entirely. I had a really _fun_ break, the best in a while, getting a desire to work on something and just doing it! For no reason! More of _that_ please.
