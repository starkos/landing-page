blurb: Die, Cthulu
---

- **Got a simple `NSCollectionView` wired up,** and can now navigate between a "library" collection view and "reader" web view in [my little web book reader](https://github.com/starkos/webbook-reader). (I'm doing this in C# and Xamarin so it's a little trickier than it sounds, though not terribly so).
- **Researched various 2D and 3D level approaches** in games and decided to try a hybrid orthographic 3D "floor" with 2D billboard sprites for _Long Walk_. Picked out some [Kenny assets](https://kenney.nl) to get things started. Now just need to learn enough [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to begin putting blocks together. Learned more Godot scripting while I was at it.
- **Played around with Amiga emulators** [FS-UAE](https://fs-uae.net) and [AROS](http://www.aros.org). Fun and inspiring, but ended up deciding that it would be too much work to pursue my ideas here. Wrote up what I learned and tucked it away for another day.
- **Moved the drums downstairs** to the soon-to-be music room (i.e. the basement) and wired back into the computer and the Playstation.
- **Played some new board games:** [Cthulu: Death May Die](https://www.cmon.com/product-line/cthulhu-death-may-die/) and [Nemesis](https://awakenrealms.com/games/awaken-realms/nemesis), both of which were super fun. (And I survived both!)
