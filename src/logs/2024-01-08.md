blurb: Reviewing and rolling up
---

Because I [got so fixated on publishing](/logs/2024-01-07/) something that I hadn't even written yet I'm all out of sync. So I spent yesterday, and likely today as well, reviewing and rolling up the just completed  cycles. And since it is the big bang date that means looking over the previous week and month and quarter and year, both forward and ahead. I don't spend nearly as much time on this kind of thing as I have in the past, but I do like to spend enough to gain something from it. So maybe another day or two, and then back to making.

Once upon a not that long ago I was pretty diligent about retrospecting and planning at the day, week, "cycle" (six weeks, per Ryan Singer's _[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)_), and year. Now I try to capture wins, challenges with possible solutions, and insights on my daily notes. And the end of the week I skim back over them and copy anything good over to a per-week log entry. And the end of the month I skim back over the week logs, repeat for quarter, and year. Learning from my past experiences via [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). I don't really do any formal forward looking planning at this point; I hate having to pick and choose and, at any interval longer than a day or two, my attention and enthusiasm moves. So now I just kinda do everything, all at once, all the time? I may write it up some day.
