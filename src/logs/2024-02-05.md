blurb: Keyboard goes clicky-clack
---

_Still_ buried in family and day job. When will it end?!

A while back I installed [Klack](https://tryklack.com) on my MBP and quickly got hooked on it. I miss mechanical keyboards but love my laptop! But Klack has an unfortunate habit of just _stopping_ at seemingly random times and needing to be quit via Activity Monitor. This week it happened at just the right time to kick me into [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) to knock out my out version. No bells and whistles yet but I've got my clicky-clack keyboard back, and it was fun to have a project I could just sit down and knock out.

Not sharing this project (yet) because I'm using Klack's sound sets. If I can find or make another I'll post the code.
