blurb: web logs and web books
---

Still head down trying to get something delivered for The Client and so I'm not able to make for myself much for the time being. It's okay though. Once I get through this stretch perhaps I'll reserve a few days (a week?) to put my head down for myself. But I was able to build a bit here and there, mostly in front of the (American) football games.

- Added a simple chronological creative log to the personal site (what, and where, you're reading right now). [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) makes this pretty dern easy. Want to give everything another once over and then _ship it_.
- I :heart: _[Dead Winter](https://deadwinter.cc/page/1)_ but reading it in a browser is a drag. It doesn't remember when I left off, or how I had the zoom set, and there's none of the niceties of a "proper" e-book. So I bootstrapped a [simplest useful "webbook" reader](https://github.com/starkos/webbook-reader/tree/develop): a web view in a window which opens to the first page of _Dead Winter_ then remembers where I left off. I'm adding a persistent zoom level now, then I'd like to add support for additonal books so I can use it for _[Essential Câ™¯](https://essentialcsharp.com/home)_ as well. Could go a few different directions with this one, we'll see.
- I think I _may_ have finally gotten Java & [Gradle](https://gradle.org) & [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) & [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org) and [Java Language Server](https://github.com/eclipse-jdtls/eclipse.jdt.ls) & VS Code & Eclipse to all play cooperatively, but I also may not have. I'm afraid to touch it. ðŸ˜¬
- Started watching [Monarch: Legacy of Monsters](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/monarch-legacy-of-monsters/umc.cmc.62l8x0ixrhyq3yaqa5y8yo7ew). What an absolutely bonkers first episode.
