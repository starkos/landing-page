blurb: Paying the bills

Big push on billable platform work.

- [Dagger](https://dagger.dev) is more or less working now
- Revisiting how the system boots itself up, pulling apart a few major systems that became excessively coupled
- Tricky: the platform provides a base functional layer, which then get specialized for particular target systems, which then gets specialized for specific clients. Figuring out where to balance inheritance vs. composition; minimizing the number of bindings the client code is required to specify; how to ensure changes to the lower levels can be picked up cleanly in existing builds without excessive rework.

New arrangement with the client means I get one day a week to work on this uninterrupted. Today was the first day and it was *glorious!* No messages, no meetings. Progress was good but it was pen-and-paper progress as I worked through the systems design. Still not entirely comfortable with the customized client logic story but it's getting there.

Eventually I'll be knocking out a portfolio section for my personal site, at which point I'll write up an overview of this project and show some of the design. For now I'll just ramble on randomly and out of context.
