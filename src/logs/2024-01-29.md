Still rather overwhelmed with family and day job stuff. Yay, it feels good to be of service. Boo, I'm not able to make. But my system is holding up and even under this duress I was able to move things here in there in the spaces.

- Added an initial iOS build to my [starter kit](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-starter) and [simplest useful "webbook" reader](https://github.com/starkos/webbook-reader/tree/develop).
- Added zoom in/out for the macOS of the webbook reader. Enjoying working on this one.
- Researched jailbreaking a PS Vita I have lying around with the intention of setting it up for retro gaming "research". System software version is too new for [Henkaku](https://henkaku.xyz) so reading up on [h-encoreÂ²](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/h-encore-2).
- A little more progress on styling my work-in-progress [creative outlet site](https://onebetween.net). I should probably just publish and iterate at this point despite the lack of content, not sure why I haven't.
- Got initial file creation working for a little command-line budgeting application I've been messing with.
- Passed [Hraesvelgr](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Hraesvelgr)'s challenges and am all set up to take on [Nidhogg](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Nidhogg_(Final_Fantasy_XIV)). :laughing:
