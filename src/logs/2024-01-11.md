blurb: A little bit of Eleventy
---

- Spent the day ironing out the last details of a baseline [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) website setup, baking the basics of a single-column website into the [shared code module](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-publish/tree/develop) for reuse across the sites. Learned a lot from [Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app) and the [Eleventy base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/).
- Developed really simple and minimal utility-first styling based on the ideas in [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev) and [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi).
- Brought a [placeholder personal landing page](https://starkos.me/) online, running on the latest setup.

Looking ahead I'll likely have to devote a day or two to billable hours, but then I'd like to get [the next site](https://onebetween.net) soon soon soon. I'm itching to work on something other than web stuff and using that as motivation to power though (in a relaxed and easy, enjoying myself way).

Keep reminding myself that I'm doing this _for myself_ and not a client and not other people. Me me me. Have fun with it.
