blurb: What year is it?
---

Oops. Things got crazy there for a bit and I lost the thread. Let's review.

- **Brought [One, Between](https://between.net/) online!**  I've wanted to build this for ages. Just the first handful of pages so far but dang it feels good to ship something.
- **Made a friend!** [Remember when I said](logs/2024-01-07) I was setting up on [Bumble BFF](https://bumble.com/en/bff)? Well, it worked! I know, right? I can't believe it either. That was a big chunk of the missing time right there, but time well spent. Caught some shows, did some table-top gaming, really quite nice.
- **Spent a week in Mexico**; another big chunk of the missing time. Really lovely, a much needed rest and recharge.
- **Spent more time with Godot**. Still learning 2D and the scripting basics but I'm beginning to feel more comfortable, and have started playing around with some ideas of my own.
- **Added a rename solution command to [the starter kit](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-starter)**.
- **Started bringing [Industrious.Redux](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-redux) back online.** Modernizing and simplifying, working on a draft branch until everything is brought forward. Still missing collection support and examples, but I've already started using it here and there in other projects.
- **Learned to play _[Warhammer 40K](https://warhammer40000.com)_.** What have I done?!
- **Started relearning AppKit**. `NSCollectionView` specifically, which wasn't around last time I was making things for myself. Getting there.
- **Improved planning views** in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)-based workflow, and started writing it up for a future post or 20.
- **Experienced a full solar eclipse!** Drove up to Syracuse to experience the totality. So epic. ðŸ¤¯
- **Brought the bass guitar online.** Was gifted a custom-built bass by a friend of mine. Haven't played in ages and no longer have any gear, but managed to cobble together a little recording setup and start shaking off the rust.

Alright, that'll do.
