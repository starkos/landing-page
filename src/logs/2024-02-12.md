blurb: still not over
---

[Not yet](/logs/2024-02.05) apparently.

- Cut in basic image support for my [11ty base code](https://github.com/starkos/industrious-publish/tree/develop), but didn't get it live.
- Jumped through the hoops to get an [h-encoreÂ²](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/h-encore-2) image ready to install on the PS Vita but haven't actually installed it yet.
- Wrestled with deployment to iOS devices only discover that Rider is currently borked in that regard, while Visual Studio for Mac still works fine. That was a day.
- Started blowing the dust of my old Redux-for-.NET implementation. Started looking at [Redux Simple](https://github.com/Odonno/ReduxSimple) as well.
